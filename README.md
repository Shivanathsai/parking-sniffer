# Parking Sniffer

Parking Sniffer is a project aiming to create a peer to peer parking space network to solve the issue of limited parking space in major cities.

## Background And Overview

A person to person parking app that connects users in an area that need parking, with the users in an area offering parking. App utilizes Google Maps API to allow searches in a set area. Owners of parking spaces set their own price and set restrictions on type of car and range of stay.

## Functionality And MVP

- [ ] User authentication and validation. Users are both renters and sellers.  
- [ ] Creating a property . Sellers will be able to publish details about     their properties and also be able to set restrictions pertaining to the usage
- [ ] Search - utilizes Google Maps and integrates with our API for targeted search anywhere in the US.
- [ ] Renters will be able to filter and select parking spaces through the search and rent parking spaces according to their needs.
- [ ] The application will be seeded with data and deployed in heroku.

## Bonus Features

- [ ] Seller property authentication.
- [ ] Direction to sellers location though maps .
- [ ] Add boat spaces to type of property and allow renters to rent boat spaces for boats.
