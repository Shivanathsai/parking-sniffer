## Team Parking Sniffer Proposal  
 
### Elevator Proposal:  
A person to person parking app that connects users in an area that need parking with users in an area offering parking. App utilizes Google Maps to allow searches in a set area. Owners of parking spaces set their own price and set restrictions on type of car and range of stay. 
 
### Features:  
1)   User authentication and validation. Users are both buyers and sellers.  
2)  Parking spaces are separated into several categories (available car types, covered/uncovered, secure/not secured, etc.)  
3)  Making a reservation automatically makes the necessary associations in the database 
4)  Search bar utilizes Google Maps and integrates with our API for targeted search 
anywhere in the US. 
 
### Technologies: 
1)  MERN Stack: (Mongo, Express.js, React, Node.js) 
2)  Google MAPS API
